# React Practice
This project is a hands-on implementation of core React Hooks concepts including useState, useEffect, useCallback, and useRef. It features three functional components:

## Features

1) Counter: A simple, interactive counter to demonstrate state manipulation with useState.

2) Background Color Changer: Dynamically change the background color using buttons. Showcases conditional rendering and state updates.

3) Password Generator:
Generates passwords based on user preferences such as length, numbers, symbols, and lowercase characters.


- useState — for managing local component state

- useEffect — for side effects and re-renders based on dependency changes

- useCallback — to memoize functions and optimize performance

- useRef — to directly reference and manipulate DOM elements
